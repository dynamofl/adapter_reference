# OpenAI Reference Implementation Examples

This directory contains examples showing how to extend or customize the OpenAI API reference implementation for different use cases.

## Available Examples

### Custom Client Implementation

The `custom_client_example.py` file demonstrates how to create a custom OpenAI client implementation that maintains the same interface as the standard OpenAI client but adds custom functionality:

- Custom authentication mechanisms
- Enterprise-specific routing logic
- Request modification and enhancement
- Custom logging and analytics

This example shows how to replace the standard OpenAI client with your own implementation while maintaining API compatibility.

### Anthropic Claude Adapter

The `anthropic_adapter.py` example demonstrates how to create an OpenAI-compatible API that uses Anthropic's Claude models behind the scenes. This allows you to use OpenAI client libraries to interact with Claude.

### Mistral AI Adapter

The `mistral_adapter.py` example shows how to create an adapter for Mistral's API, allowing you to use the OpenAI client with Mistral models.

## Creating Your Own Client Implementation

To create a custom OpenAI client implementation:

1. Review the `custom_client_example.py` as a starting point
2. Implement the same interface as the official OpenAI client
3. Add your custom authentication, routing, and business logic
4. Replace the `get_openai_client()` function in `app.py` with your implementation

## Best Practices

When customizing the OpenAI client implementation, consider these best practices:

1. **Maintain Interface Compatibility**: Ensure your custom client has the same methods and parameters as the official client
2. **Proper Error Handling**: Convert your custom errors to match OpenAI's error format
3. **Streaming Support**: Implement streaming correctly to maintain compatibility
4. **Authentication**: Implement your organization's authentication requirements
5. **Documentation**: Document your custom client implementation thoroughly
